Gliders:
-Milestones of flight:

Engineless flight - 1852 -> Cayley's glider - 1912
Powered fixed-wing flight - 1903 -> Wright flyer - 1904
Powered rotorcraft (autogyro) - 1923 -> Cierva's C4 Autogiro (1923)
Powered rotorcraft (helicopter) - 1936 -> Focke-Angelis Fa61 (1937)
Manned Supersonic flight - 14 October 1947 -> Chuck Yaeger - Bell X1
First Sustained Supersonic Flight - North American F100 - J57 with Reheat (Afterburner)

-lateral and directional controls are used to counteract the effects of adverse yaw

-can get airborn with:
Aerotow
Catapult Launch
Wire launch(drum winch or reverse pulley) *drum winch is the most popular

-stay airborn with: (air mass must be ascending in the same rate as the rate of descent)
Thermal lift (air gets hot, it expands rapidly and rises)
Mountain lee wave lift (air is bounced back up when it hits the ground, going down a hill)
Hill lift (the air is forced to rise as it hits the hill)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
System Safety:
-Definitions:
Hazard is any situation or condition resulting from failures, malfunctions, external events or errors,
that has the potential to cause adverse consequences.

Hazard identification process is the formal means of collecting, recording, analysing, acting on and
generating feedback about hazards that affect the safety of the operational activities of the organisation.

Risk is the assessed potential in terms of severity and likelihood of the consequences of a hazard
considering the worst case scenario.

***Failure is when an item is unable to perform its intended task or function

***Integrity is the attribute of a system or an item that it can be relied upon to work correctly on demand.

***Availability is the probability that an item is in a functioning state at any given point in time

-Hazard and risk assesment process:
Identify Hazard-->Assessment of severity-->Assessment of likelihood-->Acceptability of risk-->Accept Risk or Take action to reduce risk.

-Severity is divided: Negligible, Minor, Major, Hazardous, Catastrophic

-Likelihood is divided: Frequent, Occasional, Remote, Improbable, Extremely improbable

-JAR : Joint Aviation Requirements

-Systematic Failure are failures that will occur for a given set of conditions. They are repeatable and potentially predictable
An example is software bugs or design faults. Fix by designing them out this type of fault.

-Random Failure is when a failure occurs during normal operation and are not repeatable or predictable.
Example is blowing of bulbs or failure from fatigue withing design limits. We calculate the probability of failure and
ensure that it is within acceptable bounds.

-Redundancy:
Duplex: System has two lanes. It can detect faults by cross-comparison between the two lanes. Operation can continute after
the pilot selects the "good" remaining lane.

Dual-Duplex: Systems have two operating lanes with two more lanes monitoring them. After a single fault occurs,
the monitoring lane can detect it and isolate the faulty lane. This happens automatically.

Triple systems: Have three operating lanes. System detects automatically the fault by cross-comparison of the three lanes.
Then it votes out the faulty lane. This is done automatically.

Systematic failures can be prevented by using two different types of hardware and software. If one has a design error
then it's unlikely that the second one will have the same faulty design. e.g Wheel brakes and thrust reversers.

λ is a constants that represents failure rate per hour.
Mean Time Between Failure is hours between failures (1/λ)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fixed-Wing Aerospace Vehicles:
Conventional: Single fuselage, Low, aft-swept wings, underwing engines

Landing gear:
-Ground support and control. Facilitate take-off and landing.
-Absorb kinetic energy
-Braking
-Fixed/Retractable
-Configuration(Taildragger - small gear under tail, Tricycle - three gears one under nose)

Engines/Powerplant:
-Provide thrust
-Generate electrical/hydraulic power
-Options(number, type:human,electric,turboprop,turbofan,turbojet,rocket)

Fuselage:
-Accommodate payload
-Contributes to longitudinal and directional stability
-Options(Pressurised/unpressurised,size)
It consists of the Former(rings), Bulkhead at the two ends, skin to cover everything.

Empennage (Horizontal and Vertical Tail):
-Provides aerodynamic forces to longitudinally control the aircraft(pitch-using elevator)
-Provides aerodynamic forces to directionally control the aircraft (yaw-using rudder)

Wing:
-Provides lift!
-Provides aerodynamic forces to laterally control the aircraft(roll - using ailerons)
-Stores fuel
-Options(number,size,location,shape,structural configuration)
Structure: Spar(goes through the whole wing), Ribs, Stingers(thinner and weaker metals parallel to Spar, Skin(covers the wing), Aileron, Wing Flap, Wing tip, Fuel Tank)

Flight Control System(FCS) consists of the flight control surfaces, the respective cockpit controls, connecting linkages
and necessary operating mechanisms to control the aircraft in flight

Control Surfaces:
Primary:
-Elevator (pitch)
-Aileron (roll)
-Rudder (yaw)
Secondary:
-Flaps
-Slats
-Spoilers

Flaps: high-lift devices hinged on the trailing edge of the wings
       Occupy 25-30% of the wing trailing edge inboard of the ailerons
	   As flaps are extended, the stalling speed of the aircraft is reduced by increasing the camber and the maximum lift coefficient
	   They can also increase drag during landing.

Slats: Aerodynamic surfaces on the leading edge of the wings which allow the wing to operate at a higher angle
       of attack --> increase maximum lift. By deploying slats an aircraft can land and take off in a shorter distance.
	   
Spoilers: They disrupt airflow over the wing and greatly reduce the amount of lift-->loss of altitude without gaining excessive airspeed
	      Wing load alleviation.
	      Sometimes used to roll an aircraft by decreasing the lift of the one wing(spoilerons) but unlike ailerons not increasing
	      lift of the other wing.

Increased use of composite materials to make aircrafts lighter. Cannot predict how composites will fail
Steel landing gear
Titanium engines
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Radio Systems:
*See Acronyms.txt
Communications:
-HF
-VHF
-SATCOM
Radar:
-Radio Altimeter
-Weather
Collision Avoidance:
-ATC Transponder
-TCAS

RF systems are used for communications between aircraft or ground, for navigation systems, data link with operational and safety information and services for passengers

HF: WAVELENGTH: 100m-10m
    FREQUENCY:  3MHz-30MHz
	
VHF: WAVELENGTH: 10m-1m
     FREQUENCY:  30MHz-300MHz

HF was used for long range civil data and comms links
Susceptible to interference and fading - affected by atmospheric conditions
Low information rates
Long antenna required

VHF is the most commonly used for radio communications link for data and voice on aircraft.
Shorter range because of shorter wavelength but shorter antennas
Domestic communications

SATCOM - Satellite Communications
Highest data rates and widest coverage for voice, data and passenger services
Aerospace operators use the IMMARSAT constellation of geo-stationary satellites
High gain antennas - fixed wing, pod mounted

RADAR - RAdio Detection And Range
Transmit RF energy and listen for a reflection(amount of energy bounced back)
We can determine the relative position, motion and size of an object by analysing the characteristics of the received reflection.
Used for military
Used in civil aircraft to detect weather and as a means to measure altitude.

Weather radar:
-Lives under the "radome" - the nose of the aircraft. It is made by a non-conductive material so that
 it is transparent to RF radar pulses.
-It scans the forward flight path and detects water droplets, hail or snow and indicates to the pilot the best
 path to reduce turbulance and damage to the aircraft.

Radio Altimeter:
Measures height of an aircraft when radar is pointed down(not altitude which is height relative to sea level)
Useful at lower altitudes and commonly used as a sensor for Ground Proximity Warning Systems(GPWS)

Air Traffic Controller (ATC) Transponder
Radio device that can identify friend or foe
It's an RX/TX system which transmits a code when receives an interrogating signal by air traffic control.

Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS):
Extension of ATC transponder
By sending interrogation signals many times a second and waiting for replies, each aircraft
build a picture of the aircraft in vicinity.
When the point of least separation is between 20 and 48 seconds, TA is displayed with audio warning "Traffic, Traffic"
After TA when point of least separation is between 15 and 35 seconds, RA is displayed with audio warning "Climb, Climb". Finally "Clear of conflict"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On board navigation system:
-Visual Flying Rules(VFR):
The pilot uses a map(VFR Chart) and a compass to plan his flight
Only effective at low speeds and altitudes
Requires maps covering the whole planned route
No Autopilot
Doesn't work at night or over featureless terraing

Compass:
Basic tool to determine heading.
Uses a magnetic element to align with earth's magnetic field.
Earth's magnetic field is weak.
Is affected by nearby metallic structures and electrical currents.
Less stable towards poles. No use at poles because poles are shifting.
Slow response in aircraft environment
It is only 2D

Speed Measurement:
Speed is determined from air velocity(airspeed not ground speed)

Inertial Instruments:
Accelerometer:
Measures linear acceleration of aircraft
Multiple devices can calculate all 3 axis
Gravity causes ambiguity

Gyroscopes:
Rotating mass in gimballed arrangement
Measures angular velocity and angular position, orientation relative to ground
Removes gravity ambiguity when combined with accelerometers

An Inertial Navigation System(INS) combines sensory data from gyroscopes and accelerometers
calibrated on the ground to determine position
Modern systems replace mechanical parts with solid-state equivalents e.g optical gyroscopes
The main drawback of INS is drift

Air data:
Pstatic is static pressure and is measured perpendicular to the airflow
Ptotal is the total pressure and is measured against the direction of the airflow. It's when air comes to a full stop(Total=Static+Dynamic)
Pdynamic is the dynamic pressure and is measured by calculating the difference of Ps and Pt. As speed of air increases, Pd increases.

Altitude is calculated by finding the difference between Static pressure at sea level and current static pressure.
Airspeed is calculated by finding the difference of Total and Static Pressure(Dynamic Pressure)
Vertical Speed is calculated by the differentiation of Static Pressure(rate of change of static pressure)

The airspeed indicated by the pitot tube is called Indicated Air Speed(IAS)
To derive True Air Speed(TAS), altitude and temperature are required
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Off-board navigation systems(require ground infrastructure):

Omni-directional antennas broadcast and receive in all directions
Directional antennas broadcast and receive with a particular beam pattern

Beam riding:
The aircraft tries to maximise signal to stay on course. However this only works for short distances because
the width of the signal gets wider at longer distances.
The problem of beam spreading is solved by combining two antennas and following the narrow beam between them.
Operating frequencies are the same as many TV transmitters and are susceptible to interference.

Automatic direction finder(ADF):
Aircraft with moveable directional antenna can rotate the antenna and seek the maximum signal. The ADF
can determine the bearing to the ground station(of known position)
Point to point navigation
Operating in LF bands
Became compulsory in 1937

VHF omni-directional Range (VOR):
No moving parts version of ADF
It sends a more complex signal: a rotating pencil beam and an omnidirectional pulse.
The aircraft has a fixed antenna and detects the bearing between the omni-directional signal and the pencil beam
and determines it's direction and position.
Most widely used and important radio navigation aid.
Signals are Morse Code or a voice signal to identify the station
It is line of sight because it uses VHF and requires a high number of stations located along flight paths.

Distance measuring equipment (DME):
Aircraft sends an interrogation signal to the station and times the response. Time is proportional to the distance.

Grid systems are used to determine location in 2D space by using info from 2 or more VOR stations.
However because of the high frequencies, it is limited to short range. Alternative grid systems were developed using LF RF.

Satellite navigation systems:
Transmitting stations orbiting.
Line of sight coverage over the world.
Triangulation from a minimum of 4 satellites at known locations

GPS is used alongside other navigation aids but it may never completely replace RF technologies because of concerns
over robustness, accuracy and service-denial.

On board systems such as INS have high short term accuracy but long term drift but external systems have short term errors
but long term accuracy. By SENSOR FUSION both are combined to provide overall enhanced performance.

Instrument landing system (ILS):
Localiser provides lateral position
Glides slope provides altitude information
CAT1: This permits the pilot to land with a decision height of 61m and forward visibility of 800m.
CAT2: This permits the pilot to land with a decision height of 30m and forward visibility of 350m.
CAT3a: No decision height, visibility 200m.
CAT3b: No decision height, visibility 50m.
CAT3c: No decision height, no visibility.

SUMMARY OF FREQUENCIES:
SATCOM: 1.6GHz
GPS   : 1.2GHz - 1.6GHz
VOR   : 120MHz
ILS   : 110MHz
ADF   : 190kHz - 535kHz
LORAN : 100kHz
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Flight Deck Displays:

Blind flying was demonstrated as early as 1929

The BASIC SIX instruments were defines in 1937 by the RAF:
Air speed      - Attitude  - Altitude
Turn Indicator - Direction - Vertical Speed

Attitude Indicator:
Displays pitch and roll
Also known as an artificial horizon
Aircraft represented by stationary wings while the horizon rotates behind

Turn Indicator:
Uses yaw measurement to provide information on the rate and quality of turn, ie a good turn is one without side slip
Normally used on smaller aircraft

Direction Indicator:
Normally driven by the inertial instruments and is complementary to a magnetic compass.
Horizontal situation indicator is used in larger aircraft

Standard T includes Air Speed, Attitude, Altitude and Direction and is a subset of the basic 6. Found in nearly every aircraft.

In addition to primary flight, navigation and system information are needed to operate the aircraft
Aircrafts became more complex and it became impossible for the pilot to fly the aircraft alone.
Flight engineer was introduced but it became obsolete because of modern computer technology.

Experimental CRT-based glass cockpit in 1975
A320 CRT flight deck in 1988
Boeing 747 LCD displays in 1995
A380 large area LCD

A380 includes an Integrated Standby flight display. It's a backup instrument providing
independent data from differing sensors and processors (for redundancy)

A380 ECAM stands for Electronic Centralised Aircraft Monitor and provides information on many of the aircraft's system.
It can reduce pilot workload by automatically displaying important information
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Head-up Displays, FLIR and Night Vision:

Head-up displays (HUD)
-Evolved from original aircraft gun sights
-Information, normally symbolic but sometimes numeric on top of their view of the outside world
-Mostly for military applications, recently for civil aircrafts
-Display mounted to the airframe
-Design Issues: Maximise field of view (FOV) and brightness of symbology

Helmet Mounted Display (HMD):
-Pilot looks through display that is helmet-mounted
-Requires accurate knowledge of the relative position of the helmet to the aircraft.
-Mostly for military applications

Both require the pilot to see both images in focus at the same time.
To achieve this the image is collimated. Image is focused at any distance

Thermal Imaging:
-Creates two dimensional representation of the temperature of a scene
-Measures intensity of infra-red emissions from a scene and convert them to a visible light image
-Higher temps produce an increase of radiation at all frequencies.

Forward Looking InfraRed(FLIR):
-Common application of thermal imaging
-If displayed head down, it will include targeting information from the RADAR system
-If displayed head down, it will usually be overlaid with primary flight information

InfraRed Search and Track (IRST):
-They are passive and it is not possible to detect if an IR system is in use.
-Latest developments of IR imaging systems have combined FLIR systems with target identification to
produce a system capable of detecting and tracking a target and launching weapons without being detected

NightVision Systems:
-They collect any reflected light and amplify it to a level the human eye can detect.
-Photons at starlight level-->Convert to electrons-->Amplify electrons-->Convert to photons-->Photons at daylight level

First Generation Cascade Tubes:
-Amplification up to x50
-Photocathode made of Gallium Arsenide
-Drawback: Starlight levels need more than x50 amplification. More stages were linked together and this
           caused blur because of phosphor persistence

Second Generation - Micro Channel Plates:
-Formed by the bundle of a million glass fibre tubes fused into a plate.
-Electrons hitting the plates produce a variable number of secondary electrons
-The gain can be as high as 50000.
-Greater noise than the first generation but much greater gain.

NVG Types:
Type 1 - Direct View:
Outside world only through NVG and instruments are seen by looking below NVG

Type 2 - Projected View:
Both outside world with unaided eye and NVG IR spectrum are seen.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Propulsion 1:
Four Stroke Piston Engines:
-Mainly used by General Aviation and light helicopters
-Power levels generally in the 100 - 500 HP class
-Most Common: Lycoming O-235-L2C

Two Stroke:
-Offer more power at the expense of fuel economy & noise
-Technological developments in this field ar addressing this issue

Turbochargers:
-An externally driven compressor driven by a turbine using exhaust gases
-The device is designed to maintain the sea level power to altitude
-Above the critical altitude the engine-supercharger combination is no longer capable of delivering full power

Aero Diesel Engines:
Advantages:
-Excellent fuel economy
-No complicated ignition system
-Diesel is less flammable than petrol
-Diesel easily available
-High reliability

Disadvantages:
-Weight

Gas Turbine:
Air goes to compressor-->Combustion chamber (mixed with hydrocarbon energy)-->Turbine-->Nozzle
The combusted air pushes the output turbine and via shaft the energy is transferred to the Compressor. (feedback process)

Overall efficiency is the efficiency of the Energy Conversion and Propulsive Efficiency.

Efficiency of Energy Conversion = useful mechanical energy/energy supplied by fuel
Propulsive Efficiency = useful work / useful work+unused KE in jet.

***Specific Fuel Consumption(SFC) = Fuel flow per unit of Thrust***

SPECIFIC THRUST = Thrust per unit Mass Flow

Intake Flow is the flow of air going to the gas turbine
Core Flow is the air going inside the engine core(compressor and combustion chamber)
By-Pass flow is the air going inside the engine but outside the engine core (combustion chamber and compressor)

Civil Turbofans:
High by-pass ratio
Fuel efficiency and emissions are important-->move a large mass of air to a low jet velocity (reduces jet noise)
                                              at the expense of size and weight

Military Turbofans:
Low by-pass ratio Reheated Turbofan
Size and weight are important --> move small mass flow of air to high velocity

Both need as high efficiency of energy conversion as possible -->temperature that the air is raised to should be as high as possible

SFC is improved by:
-Higher Propulsive Efficiency (CONWAY - 1960)
  -Reduced jet velocity
  -Larger fan moving more air at lower speed
  -Increasing bypass ratio

-Higher Thermal Efficiency (BR 715 - 1996)
  -Overall pressure ratio (OPR)
  -Turbine temperatures (TET)
  -Component efficiencies

1960 MOST OF THE NOISE FROM THE JET

2000 NOISE IS BALANCED

Major Pollutants:
-Oxides of Nitrogen depends on Flame Temperature
-Carbon Monoxide (Negligible problem except at idle conditions)
-Unburnt Hydrocarbons (Negligible problem except at idle conditions)
-Smoke (carbon particles)
-Sulphur Dioxide

Turbine cooling:
High temperature gives high thermodynamic efficiency
Blades must be cooled
-Single Pass Internal Cooling
-Singled Pass Multi-Feed internal cooling with film cooling
-Quintuple pass, multi-feed internal cooling with extensive film cooling

Fans - Titanium
Compressor - Steel
Combustor and Turbines - Nickel based alloys
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Introduction to Rotary-Wing Aerospace Vehicles:

First manned rotary winged aircraft (no powered rotor):
Cierva C4 Autogiro - 17 January 1923 - Juan de la Cierva
Cierva C1 Autogiro - 1920
Cierva C2 Autogiro - 1922
Cierva C3 Autogiro - 1921

**Main difference of the autogyro and the helicopter is that the helicopter can hover**

Cierva's death in 9th December 1936 marked the end of any further development of the autogyro.

Dr Igor Bensen developed the basic design into a form that has been adopted by nearly all sport autogyro designers to date.

The Achilles Heel of autogyro: The Off-Loaded Rotor and Thrust Dependent Control - The Two-Bladed Teetering Rotor
Control of the aircraft totally depends on thrust meaning that we change the Thrust vector to control the aircraft

The solution is to create a flap hinge meaning that the two flaps can move separately and not as a long flap.

BUT once you start making the autogyro more complex, you run the risk of reinventing the helicopter.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Aircraft Power Systems - Electrical:

Watt is rate of work/joules per second

Early aircraft used electrical power for ignition. This demand could be satisfied by a small battery or generator.

As aircraft developed, more systems were added such as lighting, instrumentation and communication equipment.
The electrical power system became similar to what we would find on a car: a 12V(or 24V) system with a lead-acid battery
recharged by an engine-driven generator.

Modern aircraft have a higher demand of electrical power. They feature multiple generators and system voltages
and are designed to provide redundancy in case of a component failure.
**A typical system includes a 3 phase 115 VAC 400Hz system for high power loads and a backup system based on a 28VDC.**

Three phase systems feature phase voltages displaced by 120 degrees.

Converting from AC to DC:
Called Rectification
Can be carried out by mechanically or electrically (with passive or active components)

Converting from DC to AC:
-Called Inversion
-More complicated than rectification
-Complex to achieve with mechanical components
-Associated with modern power electronic techniques.

Three categories: Sources, Distribution, Users

Light Aircraft: 
A few kVA into a low voltage system.

Large Aircraft:
Driven by auxiliary gearboxes on engine. Several generators, each 100KVA+, complex multi voltage system.

A generator driven by the engine will have variable output frequency because of the aircraft engine running at variable speeds.
This is not a problem where output is rectified immediately
With an AC distribution system:
-Allow frequency to vary - "frequency wild"
-Drive generator from constant speed gearbox

Storage:
Batteries:
-DC Components
Primary Cells - The chemical reaction is not reversible and once the cell is fully discharged it is discarded
Secondary Cells - Reversing the current reverses the electro-chemical reaction. They can be recharged.

Aerospace Secondary Cells:
Lead Acid:
-Most mature cell technology.
-They have good charge/discharge characteristics.
-They vent produce corrosive elements during normal operation (gassing)
-Techniques used to minimise gassing and the risk of leakage.
-Wide range of temperatures.
-Simple to recharge
-Easy to recycle

Ni-Cad battery:
-Their chemistry allows them to be fully sealed reducing the risk of leakage
-Greater capacity than Lead-Acid
-Operate poorly under low temperatures
-More complex recharging
-Hard to recycle.

APU battery location: Empenage
Main battery: Cockpit
They are both 24V

Auxiliary Power Unit (APU)
-A small gas turbine engine
-Provides backup for hydraulic, pneumatic and electrical power systems.
-Enables the aircraft to self-start
-Fitted with electrical generator similar to the main engines

Ram Air Turbine (RAT):
The ram air turbine is an air driven generator that is dropped into the air after everything else has failed
It will provide electrical and hydraulic power in case of failure of both engine driven generators and the APUs.

Ground Power Unit(GPU):
Strictly not part of the aircraft. External power for ground functions.

A battery will more likely have a voltage level more than the nominal figure
The specs of the aircraft DC bus allows for variations in the voltage

The reason companies switch to a more electric aircraft is reduce cost of operating aircraft.
The reason for the massive jump in power in 787 is the elimination of the airbleed system. This extra
power is used to run the environmental control system.

A380 has an electro-hydraulic FCS Actuator
Conventional airliners have a hydraulic distribution system, transferring hydraulic power from the engines
to the flight surface actuator.
The A380 broke the tradition and distributed power electrically to the flight surface and then used local system
to drive the surface.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hydraulic and Pneumatic Systems:
-Oil in the space between the outside teeth is pumped from suction to discharge
-Gear pumps can be noisy so constant mesh patterns like herringbone may be used

Creating pressure: Hydraulic pumps
-Use a rotating swash plate to push pistons in and out.
-Can direct fluid from inlet to outlet side.

Hydraulic pumps have higher power density than electric machines
In most aircraft the pumps maintain a system pressure of around 3000 psi independent of flow rate.

One advantage of hydraulic systems is that we can easily produce the linear motion required for flight surface actuation
with hydraulic cylinders.

Hydraulic fluid is stored in a reservoir that feeds the pressure pump
Pressurised fluid directed around the system using a series of valves
The fluid exiting the cylinder, flows around and returns back to the reservoir

Because of instant response, makes hydraulic systems good for moving flight control surfaces
Hydraulic pumps are powered by the engine via mechanical or electrical system. They also have backup from APU and RAT.
Multiple hydraulic circuits provide redundancy.

They are expensive because they are complex and require a high level of cleanliness.
The fluid used on aircraft is highly corrosive to many materials.

Redundancy is achieved by using dual-tandem actuators

Pneumatic System:
Engine Start:
-Many large turbines are started by an air-powered starter motor on the assessor gearbox which mechanically drives one of the engine shafts
-Blast of air directly to the turbines
-Power from an engine already running or the APU.

Bleed Air:
-Hot air under pressure taken from one or more compressor stages.
-Used for wing de-icing - hot air ducted onto the leading edge
-For powering the air conditioning system.

Air Cycle Machine (ACM) conditions the air, cools it down and removes moisture to provide the temperature of air to the cabin

Cabin air is a mix of fresh external air and re-circulated cabin air that has been passed for HEPA filters.
The total volume of cabin air is replaced 25 times per hour
Cabin pressure is controlled to reduce rates of change of pressure.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Computing And Buses:

Generic airborne computer:
-Task oriented computer (designed to do a few functions)
-Embedded system ( part of a wider system)
-Real time (able to perform task within a defined timescale)

Data bus: Connects component together.

-1553 - Military
-ARINC 429 - Civil

Bus Controller:
-Commands the various remote terminals to send or receive messages
-Services requests from the remote terminals.
-Operates according to commands stored in local memory.

Remote terminal:
-Interface between data bus and external subsystem or another data-bus.

Bus Monitor:
-Monitors and records traffic over the bus for off-line analysis.

1553:
-Serial digital bus - data sent one bit at a time
-Each 1553 channel consists of a twisted wire pair.
-A digital 1 is represented by a voltage of approximately 20V

Consists of 3 types of word:
-Data Word
-Command Word
-Status Word

ARINC 664 AFDX
AVIONICS FULL DUPLEX SWITCHED ETHERNET
-Based on IEEE 802.3 Ethernet standard
-Similar hardware with more software constraints in software to make the system more deterministic.

*AFDX arranged users in start topologies with a switch at the hub*
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fuel:
Usage:
-Power the engines
-Control of the aircraft centre of gravity and mass distribution
-Heat sinking for other systems

Comprises of tanks,plumbing,pumps and control to facilitate these multiple uses.

-Jet fuel is kerosene-based (Jet A-1 is the standard fuel**)
-It has a higher flash point and it less flammable than piston engine fuels.
-Fuel used for international aviation generally attracts no tax

A380 has 200 tonnes of fuel

Fuel Storage:
-All joint and access panels must be sealed
-A natural tendency for the fuel to flow towards the pump is essential.
-Intermediate ribs have to allow the fuel to flow and act as fuel baffles (*to prevent sloshing during manoeuvring)

90% of the wing volume is usable.
Loss is made up of: Structural displacement, Expansion space, Trapped Air, Unusable fuel, Equipment displacement, Sealant.
Fuel can also be stored under the cabin floor, Aft fuselage or tail cone, cabin tanks ahead of the fuselage pressure bulkhead, wet empennage.

Ways to measure fuel:
-Capacitance systems
-Ultra sonic systems

Referred by precision : Class 1(5%), Class 2(2%), Class 3(1%)

Fuel delivery by Motive flow: Small quantity of high pressure fuel provided by a mechanical pump at the engine to
power a jet pump at the wing tank.

Two ways to refuel:
-Using gravity and an opening on top of the wing at around 75% wing tank span. It is impossible to over-fuel the aircraft
and it leaves a large enough "air bubble" for the fuel system to work.
-Modern aircraft also have single point pressurized refuelling capability at a wing root or under wing.

Fuel issues:
-Water in fuel can freeze and cause a blockage and therefore water content is monitored.
-Tanks must be vented to allow air in and out during use and refuelling.
-This creates a space above the liquid fuel filled with air or fuel vapour.
-Inerting is when this space is filled with a gas like nitrogen rather than air.
