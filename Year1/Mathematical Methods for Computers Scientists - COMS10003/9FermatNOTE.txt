//  == stands for congruence

a^(p-1)==1 (mod p)

Show that 13 divides 2^50 + 3^50
->Prove that (2^50 + 3^50) == 0 (mod 13)
Since 13 is prime we know that a^12==1 (mod 13) when a is not divisible by p
Hence, 2^12==1 (mod 13), 3^12==1(mod 13)

2^50 + 3^50 = 2^(48+2) + 3^(48+2) = 2^48 * 2^2 + 3^48*3^2

2^(4^12) ---> 2^4 is relatively prime to 13 because 13 is a prime --> 2^4^12 == 1 (mod 13)
same for 3^(4^12)

2^50 + 3^50 = (2^4^12)*2^2 + (3^4^12)*3^2 == 1 * 2^2 + 1 * 3^2 (mod 13) = 13 == 0 (mod 13) ---> DIVISIBLE!
