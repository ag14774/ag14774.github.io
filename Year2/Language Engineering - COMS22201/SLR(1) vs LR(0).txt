In the ACTION[s,a] table(what to do if terminal symbol a is read in state s):
shift s'      if s contains A->a.ab
reduce A->g   if s contains A->g. (AND a elem of FOLLOW(A)) <-- This part is the difference between SLR and LR
accept        if s contains S'->S.


Algorithm:
1)When action is shift s', push s' on stack and remove the matched terminal symbol from input(in the next loop)
2)When action is reduce, pop |g| symbols from stack, find production on GOTO table and push.
3)LOOP
