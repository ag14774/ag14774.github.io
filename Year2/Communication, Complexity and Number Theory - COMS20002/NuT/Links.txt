Raising to the power of the order of the group(Euler's theorem):
http://math.stackexchange.com/a/629728/262817
To rephrase here a bit: If a is a generator of G, then raising it to the power of the order of the group guarantees that it will cycle through all the elements and return to the identity. If a is not a generator of G then Lagrange's theorem guarantees that the order of the subgroup generated by a divides |G| and therefore if a^|a|=1 then (a^|a|)^u=1 where |G|=u|a|.
