# Cellular Automaton Farm

"The task is to design and implement a small process
farm on the xCore-200 Explorer board which simulates the ‘Game of
Life’ on an image matrix. The board’s buttons, accelerometer, and
LEDs should be used to control and visualise aspects of the game.
The game matrix should be initialised from a PGM image file and the
user should be able to export the game matrix as PGM image files.
The solution should make efficient and effective use of the
available parallel hardware of the architecture by implementing
farming and communication of parts of the game matrix across
several cores based on message passing."
