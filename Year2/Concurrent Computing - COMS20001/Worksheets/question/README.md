# Realview-PB-A8-Kernel

The overarching goal of this assignment is to develop an initially simple but then increasingly capable operating
system kernel. It should execute and thus manage resources on a specific ARM-based target platform, namely
a RealView Platform Baseboard for Cortex-A8 emulated by QEMU.
